 Practice 4-9: Pattern creation with lines and circles with mousePressed<br/>
 Practice 5-1: Mosaics with text and image<br/>
 Practice 5-2: Mosaic with text and hue change<br/>
 Practice 5 mouseX_hue_change: Change in hue depend on mouse's x location<br/>

 Practice 5 3x3_random_tint_change: Continuous change in tint of 9 pictures randomly <br/>
 Practice 5 3x3_hue_change: Random change in hue of 9 pictures <br/>
 Practice 5 David_Hockney: Moving mimicry of the artist David Hockney <br/>
 Practice 5 grid_pattern: Displaying and repeating images like a small grid<br/>
 Practice 5 mouseX_mouseY_color_picker: Printing the RGB value of the location where is clicked by the mouse<br/>
 Practice 5 RGB_ave_monotone_hue_change: Change image into monotone with RGB value adjustment<br/>
 Practice 5 Text_Image: Mosaic image with text of following color<br/>

# Practice_#2
 Practice 6 Circular_Mosaic_1: Mosaic a picture with circles. Radius change depend on brightness value (Bigger circles) <br/>
 Practice 6 Circular_Mosaic_2: Mosaic a picture with circles. Radius change depend on brightness value (Smaller circles)<br/>
 Practice 6 Font_Mosaic_1: Mosaic a picture with a word written by the programer.<br/>
 Practice 6 Font_Mosaic_2: Mosaic a picture with a word written by the programer. The size of the word decided by the brightness value.<br/>
 Practice_6_Font_Mosaic_with_Function: Mosaic a picture with a word written by the programer. The size of the word decided by the brightness value. Coded using a customized function.<br/>
 Practice_6_Line_Mosaic: Mosaic a picture with lines with following color.<br/>
 Practice_6_Monotone_Circular_Mosaic: Mosaic a picture with monotoned circles.<br/>
 Practice_6_Pixel_Art: Mosaic a picture with rectangles.<br/>

 Practice_6_Video_3D_Mosaic: Mosaic a video with rectangles with 3D effect<br/>
 Practice_6_Video_Circular_Mosaic: Mosaic a video with circles<br/>
 Practice_6_Video_control: Control pause, fastfoward and resume of the video with keyboard.<br/>
 Practice_6_Video_Line_Mosaic: Mosaic video with lines<br/>
 Practice_6_Video_Rect_Mosaic: Mosaic video with rectangles. Two versions: (1) rectangle size changes depend on the brightness and (2) rectangle size is constant.<br/>
 Practice_7_Brick_Breaker_Demo: Rectanglar boards floating across<br/>
 Practice_7_Camera: Connecting Mac camera to Processing<br/>
 Practice_7_Mouse_Postion_Warm: A series of circles following the path of the mouse<br/>
 Practice_7_Multiple_Bricks: Rectangular boards with random colors floating across<br/>
 Practice_8_Button_and_Change_Color: A grid of gray squares which change color when clicked<br/>
 Practice_8_Circle_Packing: Circle packing<br/>
 Practice_8_Eastern_Chess_Board: A grid of gray squares which change color when clicked and maintain the changed color after the click<br/>
 Practice_8_One_Button_Different_Color: A grid of gray squares which change color. One square has a different changed color. <br/>
 Practice_8_Rectangle_Colors: Allowing only a specific squares from the grid to change color when clicked<br/>
 Practice_8_Smoke: Circle particles rising with decreasing opacity. Smoke-like effect.<br/>
 Practice_8_Smoke_Controled: Particle generation controlled by mousePressed<br/>
 Practice_8_Smoke_Moving_and_Hidden: Particles do not appear when mouse is not pressed.<br/>
